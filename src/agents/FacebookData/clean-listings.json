    "description": "Hey everyone! I am looking for someone to take over my bedroom in a 2-bed 1-bath apartment near Lake Merritt. I have lived with my roommate for the past year but I am moving closer to my university. It is a very clean and comfortable space, and looking to have it filled by August first, preferably by another woman.\n\nThe Room: \nIt is cozy with great lighting. The room can comfortably fit a twin bed, a desk, a dresser, and some storage. It has two windows, a closet, and a cozy nook for your bed or desk. If needed, a twin bed can be provided.\n\nThe Apartment: \nIt is commuter-friendly, a 10-minute walk to Lake Merritt BART, and within one block of 5 different bus routes that take you straight to 12th or 19th st BART stations. If you have a car, there is ample street parking.\n\nThe unit has a fully furnished living room and kitchen, but if you would like to bring your additions, my current roommate can coordinate space for you. The unit has hardwood floors, great light throughout, and updated appliances/kitchen. The bathroom has ample storage and a bathtub/shower combo. There is a laundry mat directly across the street, making it easy for regular laundry.\n\nThe building is mostly young women and families, and we have built a close community while living here. It is a busy neighborhood, so there is a good amount of foot traffic but we have not had any issues while living here. Our neighborhood is very walkable, close to many restaurants and grocery stores.\n\nMy Roommate:\nMy roommate has a small, quiet dog, but no additional pets are allowed. The dog is very friendly and well-behaved. My roommate is a hybrid worker, so she wfh 2-3 days a week. We take turns dividing house chores and have been able to maintain a clean and comfortable environment.\n\nIf you’re interested, please message me so we can learn more about you and set up a time to meet! I can provide more images of the common spaces and the apartment upon request.\n",

We're about a block from the Irving St. corridor which has a variety of restaurants, shops and grocery stores all within walking distance. Also, within walking distance is the Sunset branch of the public library, a Wal-Greens and the Post Office. We're a short bus ride away from Stonestown and San Francisco State University, and we're also a short ride on the N from the UCSF Parnassus campus. The house is 2 blocks from Golden Gate Park and about 2 miles away from Ocean Beach. We're also not far from Cole Valley and the The Haight. \n\n\nThe room is fairly large (see pictures), it has a westward facing window and hardwood floors. The current roommate is willing to leave the closet, bed and the couch for $80. \n\n\nOur house has central heating and a washer and dryer (not coin operated) so you don’t have to drag your laundry to the laundromat! We also have a full kitchen with a dishwasher and a breakfast nook. There's a shared bathroom, a back yard and parking is available too! Additionally, we recently purchased new living room furniture (pic of living room included below)! \n\nRent is $925 per month, plus utilities that range from $150-$200+ per month (in the colder months PG&E tends to be higher hence the range). Total move in cost is $2,050 (first and last month’s rent plus security deposit). \n\nAbout us: We're three 3 gay males in our 20's to mid-40’s. \n\nAaron: 46, works from home as a legal writer M-F. In his spare time he goes to the gym, reads a lot, watches a lot of movie (big fan of the Criterion channel) and studies French. He's also vegan. \n\nToren: 41, works in the mental health field, and mostly works from home M-F. Introvert who appreciates the arts and nature. \n\nAlex: 24, works outside the home M-F, in his spare time he likes to be active, play video games and and is a music lover. \n\nWe tend to keep the house pretty quiet, especially after 10pm. We also do a fairly good job of keeping the common areas clean. Everyone is friendly and gets along, but we don’t often hangout as a group. We also don't really drink and smoking of any kind is not allowed in the house. Pets are unfortunately not allowed either. \n\nSo if you are looking for a room in a quiet, cooperative and respectful home we'd love to hear from you! Reply to this ad with a bit about yourself and we'll be in touch to schedule a meeting. Thanks!\n\nPlease reply to this: https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/d/san-francisco-room-available-in-gay/7862905701.html",

The room dimensions are roughly 10 x 12 ft, with a roughly 3 x 4 ft closet. The rent for this room is $1125, with a security deposit of $1120. Earliest move in is Nov 9.\n \nWe like to keep our common areas fairly clean, and the unit comes with a dishwasher, in-building laundry, a spacious outdoor area in the back that we share with other tenants in the building, and central heating. We also have a cleaner that comes every 2 weeks and keeps our common areas clean. Most of the apartment is furnished already in the common areas, so you'll probably only need to end up bringing the stuff you want to keep in your room. There is no attached garage, but there is a bike storage room and an additional storage area downstairs to keep miscellaneous items. It's at a super convenient location for commuting, and just blocks away from Dolores Park as well!\n \nWe also have a cat in the house who is very social and loves to cuddle, but we cannot take an additional cat or dog unfortunately. \n \n \n* The room is furnished in the photos, but will be empty and clean before you arrive.\n \n \n \nAbout us:\nAndrew (27M): Hi!  I like to play tennis, read sci-fi and history, ski, run, bike, and bake things to share. Excited to meet you!\n \nNoah (26M): Hey! I'm a BMI PhD student at UCSF. I enjoy cooking, hiking, movies, video games, and exploring the Bay. Looking forward to meeting you! \n\nAlex (26M): Hey! I work at UCSF in a clinical research lab. I'm interested in going to grad school in the future. I love to watch movies, hike, and I'm not a huge fan of cooking.",
