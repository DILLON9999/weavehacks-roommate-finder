If this sounds like it could be a good fit for you please respond to this posting with some basic info about yourself (links to social media highly encouraged/prioritized!)\n\n\nAbout the house:\n\n4 bed, 2 bath located near the corner of 25th and Balboa. We’re right on the 31 bus route/within walking distance to both the 5 and 38. The neighborhood is cozy/quiet (for SF) and walking distance from a few markets (a few mom and pops/Grocery Outlet/Safeway), some good restaurants on Geary/Clement, GG Park, and several Beaches (Ocean/Baker/China). If you have a car street parking is pretty manageable and we rotate sharing the one car garage.\n\n\nThe home has a washer/dryer onsite (no coin op) and a small backyard that's great for grilling during the Summer. The common areas are fully furnished (though if you come with furniture we can definitely discuss switching out pieces that may be a better fit for the space). We all use the garage for storage of outdoor gear, bikes, and miscellaneous things we can’t fit into our rooms.\n\n\nThe room we’re looking to fill is spacious (12x14) and has a great closet with lots of storage. It’s at the back of the house, so it’s fairly quiet and it shares a bathroom with another roommate on the bottom floor. It is unfurnished, but easily fits a queen bed, desk, etc. (All furniture in the bedroom pics are from a previous roommate)\n\n\nRent is split evenly with each of us paying $1075/m. Security deposit is $1462.50 and due at the time the lease is signed, so total move in cost would be $2537.50. Utilities (trash/internet/water/gas) come out to just under $90/m, but varies with water/heat use. Our awesome landlord is kind and responsive, but not overbearing in any way. She does a credit check before signing, but keeps the rent low to attract solid tenants, so we do our best to maintain the house as a massive thank you to her for being fantastic.\n\nAbout us:\n\nThe roomies are two guys and one lady, and all of us are in our 20s/30s. We get along decently and help each other out with favors when needed. We generally do our own things and keep busy, but see each other in the kitchen/living room when we're free at the same time. We try and keep our common spaces tidy/clean, with a few monthly chores split between all of us. We are not overly strict about COVID precautions, although we are all vaccinated, etc. We enjoy hosting friends for dinner and drinks here and there (think low key weeknight dinners/drinks).  \n\n\nD - The oldest roommate (36) has been living in SF for over 10 years, mostly in this house. He used to work in food/hospitality industry (cook/server/bartender/barista/etc) but is finishing law school and devotes almost all of his time to that these days. Born in CA, but not a Bay Area native, he’s a homebody who enjoys reading, writing, video games, and a good meal.\n\nB - is 35 years old, working as a bartender and is a Bay Area native. When he's not working he enjoys live comedy, golf of all kinds, movies, and gaming. His folks live down in SJ, so every once in a while he makes the treck down to visit them and enjoy all the good food on the way.\n\nC- is a 28 year old female who works as a nanny for a family nearby and has been in the house since December. She has a cat named Luna who mostly stays in her room, but is adorable and we are trying to get her comfortable enough to explore the house as she wants. Another Bay Area native, she spends her free time going out to art events and hanging out with friends or family.",

    "description": "Hello! I am looking for a roommate to share my single family, 3BR/1BA home on the Great Highway. It is available July 1st, and there would be just two of us living here. \n\nThe place is great - clean; nice; and charming. It's a legitimate three bedroom / one bath single family home, with nice common areas for all to enjoy including an eat-in kitchen, living room, backyard, and lots of shared garage space.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Living room with inviting decor\n- A working, wood burning fireplace that we use occasionally.\n- Kitchen with granite counters\n- New dishwasher\n- Hardwood floors\n- Free washer/dryer\n- Central heating\n- Bathroom with tub and separate shower\n- Nice touches all over\n- Nicely landscaped backyard\n- Garage with surfboard rack \n- Spare bedroom\n- Plenty of space for storage, office, art studio, etc.\n\nA bit about the location: we are on the lower Great Highway, literally across the street from the beach and the newly closed Great Highway Park. Noriega and Judah street businesses are a short walk away. Outer Sunset neighborhood haunts include various nice restaurants, coffee shops, a killer taco truck, bakeries, two excellent markets, bars, late night corner stores, and good vibes. Parking is never a problem, and the neighborhood is one of the friendliest, quietest places to live in San Francisco.\n\nI currently share the house with one roommate, who lives is the downstairs bedroom and uses one of the upstairs bedrooms as a work from home office. Previous roommates have used the garage to set up things like an art studio, bike storage, or bench press. The vacating roommate will also be leaving a large amount of garage space unused, which you could potentially use to fulfill your wildest dreams.\n\nA bit about me: I'm a woman in my early 40s and a server at a great Italian restaurant in the Mission, and I love living on the Great Highway. I keep it mellow at home; sometimes I will have a few friends over but mostly use the place to relax and cook meals.  I don't have any pets. \n\nRent: $2100/month (this is an even split of the current rent). Move in: First month's rent + security deposit. I require a signed roommate agreement, and ask that you plan to stay for at least one year.\n\nPlease reach out if you have any questions!",

    "location": "oakland west",
    "description": "hi lovelies! 😊 If you're seeing this post, then you're in luck because Obsidian House is looking for another queerio to come and join our lil community out in West Oakland! ❤️\n\nTo get into the deets, the room is a cozy bedroom with tile floors, high ceilings, and a tall east-facing window offering sunlight and privacy. It has a built-in closet and can comfortably fit a full/queen size bed and a desk. Additionally, there is plenty of wall space available for you if you'd like to put up shelving or other knickknacks :3 \n\nFor extra storage space, there is a small communal closet in the hallway. We also have a very large downstairs basement with our own laundry room and an excess of space for storage and artistic/studio projects (we have a sewing table and a previous roomie had a lil carpentry setup down there). \n\nThe living room is large with 3 bay windows, a high-vaulted ceiling, pretty views, and large, comfy couch. It's a space that could comfortably host a large group of friends if you wanted. The kitchen is similarly spacious and proximal to the living room. We have a shared two-room bathroom (one room has a large bathroom vanity/jack & jill sink and the other has the toilet/shower) that is well-ventilated and decently roomy. \n\nWe also have a pretty spacious backyard that is absolutely gorgeous during the day. The space is quite verdant and great for lil get-togethers, eating lunch, drinking tea and watching the birds, just overall a very cute space to hang out it (we also have a grill for any aspiring grill dads out there 👀) \n\nThe house is near Filbert and 16th, is ~a 20 minute walk from the 12th and 19th St BART stations, and is in a quiet neighborhood with many small parks nearby :D Lake Merritt, DT Oakland, and Jack London are around 5-8 minutes away by car and bike respectively. The location is far enough from the highway that we don't get any noise but is quite central if you want to get into SF (I can drive to SOMA in approximately 12-20 minutes depending on traffic).\n\nYou would be living with 3 other roomies in their mid/late 20s. The vibe is warm and very chill, we enjoy regular conversation and music. Here's a lil bit about ourselves below: \n\nHousemates:\nI (she/her): (28) Quechua trans woman with a flair for brujeria and queer art, loves dancing, writing poetry, drawing sigils, pyrography, gaming, music, and general explorative chaos. enjoys going on adventures and finding gay lil spots to haunt. autistic ambivert that enjoys hanging out in any context. Hexxus's mom \n\nE: (she/her): (26) mixed azn trans woman, digital artist and rave girl, into diyt, folk punk, emo, old films, fossils, sci fi, leftism, quiet night owl, out and about a lot, autistic and covid conscious\n\nE (he/him): (24) Queer trans man with a love of cats and kitty💅. Loves walkable cities and swimming, jazz and rnb music, always down for chisme and a chat. Night owl ambivert, theatre kid, team player and receptive roomie :)\n\nHexxus (they/them): lil black kitty with big zoomy energy, very shy at first but quite cuddly and affectionate once they get to know you, silly tongue blep and cat loaf extraordinaire \n\nEveryone is conscientious about making the space a comfy, happy space to live in and we're looking for roomies that are interested in being a part of the community we share together :3 We're all quite proactive communicators, and put in effort to make house expenses and chores as equitable as possible. We share a few basic household supplies, but don't have a fully communal food/cooking system or anything, so if you're looking for a bit of co-op lite vibes, this would be perfect for you! The house is 420 and SW/sex-positive, along with being cat friendly (as long as your kitty is comfy sharing space with another cat). However, we can't accept a dog at this time due to one of the roomies being allergic :(\n\nIn terms of the application process, we are looking for someone to move in on August 1st and eventually renew on a one-year lease with the three of us starting in November. Our landlord unfortunately requires that you have decent credit standing (~670 or more) and make 3x the rent (~2235 a month).\n\nIf interested, please send over an email detailing a little bit about you, what you do for work, whether you meet the application requirements, and your hobbies/interests. Looking forward to hearing from ya! ;3\n\n$745/month.\nLocation: near Filbert & 16th\nNearby transit: Nearby 12th, 19th, & West Oakland BART, quite a few bus lines around :D \nMove-in date: August 1st\nSecurity Deposit: one month's rent\nLandlord: Requires at least a ~670 credit score and that you make 3x the rent for your room\nUtilities: averages around $100 a month, split between roomies\nBathrooms: one two-room bathroom with a Jack & Jill sink, shared between roomies\nLaundry: Washer and dryer in-unit\nBedrooms: 4\nKitchen: Microwave, stove/oven, instantpot, stand mixer, shared cupboards and fridge  \nBackyard: Lovely lil sunny backyard with lots of space for social gatherings. We also have a loquat tree that's perfect to eat fruit from during the summer ;3 \nPets: Open to cats",

I love foraging for plants, making art, doing drag, riding my bike, and cooking with people. I’m fairly social so looking for a roommate that’s okay with my having a friend or partner over. I always do my dishes, like to be tidy and put things away by the end of the day, and im also okay with a little dirt…not too fussy. I’m also responsive in to feedback on cleaning if there are areas you prefer to be spotless. Looking for someone to chat with at the end of the day and be friendly. Awesome if we end up being friends. Great if we want to share food though not required. \n\nText me to schedule a time to chat on the phone!",

    "location": "campbell",
    "description": "Seeking: A kind and empathetic woman or woman-identifying person to share my 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Campbell. I’m offering reduced rent in exchange for pet care. Ideally, I’m looking for someone with prior experience handling dogs, especially as mine is getting older and more reactive on walks. That said - if you’re not able to offer pet care but feel like we’d be a good match, feel free to reach out anyway.\n\nRent: $1,180/month (includes water, trash, and sewer; total rent for the unit is approximately $2,950/month)\n\n Location: La Valencia Apartments, Campbell (2nd floor, short flight of stairs)\n<10 min walk to Safeway and Campbell Plaza\n<15 min walk to Winchester VTA Station\nAbout the Space:\nYour Room: Spacious and full of natural light (not the master).\n\nBathroom: Private and roomy - your own.\n\nCommon Areas: Fully furnished, including the kitchen.\nPlease note: I don’t have a lot of room for additional furniture in the common areas. This setup is best for someone who’s comfortable keeping most of their things in their own bedroom. You’ll have access to kitchen cabinets and a shared fridge space, but storage is limited outside the room.\n\nAbout Me:\nI’m a 36-year-old tech professional who values kindness, empathy, and community. I work a hybrid schedule—some days from home, some at the office. I love dancing (I take classes in the South Bay), watching TV, reading, and spending time with good people. \nI occasionally eat meat, so this isn’t a vegetarian household. Because of a chronic illness, I’m home a lot and tend to create a cozy, guest-friendly environment. I’m queer-friendly and would love to live with someone who shares similar values. I care deeply about community and social justice, and I value thoughtful, inclusive conversations at home. If you’re someone who also thinks about the world beyond these walls, we’ll probably get along great.\n\nAbout You:\nI’d love to share my home with someone who is:\nKind, helpful, and considerate\nIdeally experienced with dog care (walking, feeding, play, and occasional pet sitting)\nComfortable around one dog (no other pets, please - mine is reactive to animals)\nIf this sounds like a fit, I’d love to hear from you. I’m a bit slow to respond sometimes due to work and health, but I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.",

    "description": "Hi there, my roomate is moving to the East coast so I am looking for a new roommate in a 3br/2.5 bath house, and you and I will be the only tenants.\n\nThis is for the master bedroom of a house in a pretty quiet family neighborhood. Basically it will be me + you sharing a full sized house and we each have a different bedroom and share the rest of the house.\n\n\nMove in date: Aug 1 2025 (but my roomate will be out around mid July so early move in is possible), lease is yearly\n\nI don't have any annoying \"rules” and anyone can gladly be my roommate if you are nice and respectful, and I am the same! We will both live there and it will be our home, so I hope both of us can be ourselves and be comfortable and happy!\n\n\nI don't own the house, I am also just renting the other room, so the rules are just whatever is on the lease (typical stuff like no pets and no smoking) but the landlord is very chill though and you’ll probably never see him\n\n\nThere are 3 bedrooms:\na- $1450 - this is the available room, it is the master bedroom which is the biggest room and also has the private bathroom in the room\nb- $1250 - this is my room, its a medium size and the bathroom is in the hall next to it\nc- Not for rent - this is the smallest room and we basically just use it as a closet/guest room and it even has a bed if you have friends visiting.\n\n\nAbout me:\nI am a 31 year old software engineer male\nI get along with everyone\nWhen I am at home you will usually see me in my room on the internet or watching some show.\nOn the weekends I will either hang out with my girlfriend/friends, eat out at some nice restaurants, or just relax at home\n\n\nAbout the house:\n-It is a full normal sized 2-story house, 3br/2.5 bath, and there are no other tenants besides me+you\n-2 car garage attached to house that will fit most cars (but a bit low if you have a super tall opening trunk) and also street parking if you prefer\n-Washer/drier in the garage\n-Full kitchen with stove/oven, microwave , etc, and getting a brand new fridge in a few days\n-1 mile from several different plazas with many restaurants, boba tea places, etc\n-Backyard area, not huge but big enough to hang out and have a BBQ or something\n\n\nNote that the price doesn't include utilities, which we will split 50/50. Water bill is usually maybe $200 every 2 months, xfinity(tv/internet) depends on whichever plan we choose. PG&E is the expensive one and is usually in the 300s with a few lower months and higher in the coldest/hottest months, but for me its important to stay comfortable in our own home so if its cold I will still turn on the heat (instead of saving money if thats your concern)\na\n\nLet me know if you are interested or have any questions, ***and please write a little about yourself so I get to know you too***",

When I’m not working I’m either out with friends or hanging out in my room so sometimes it may seem like I’m not even there. I love to make new friends and would love to hangout with whoever moves in! I am incredibly easy going and don’t have a problem with a lot of things as long as you’re helping keep the place nice and clean. Feel free to decorate how you want and make this place feel like home to you. The other two roommates moved out recently. I’m in the process of finding their replacements so as of right now it’s just me. I would prefer female roommates but i am open to other options. Move in date is ASAP. Unfortunately the property manager won’t allow pets and no couples.\n\nExcellent location in South SF. A quick two minute drive to the freeway: Be in SF or San Mateo within 15 minutes! You are also a 10 minute drive from SFO. Located right across the street is Philz, Paris Baguette, Quickly, Walgreens, Pho Saigon, and various other grocery stores and restaurants. Sellick Park just next door for those great workouts or picnics.",

    "description": "Hi all - I'm looking for a roommate for a beautiful 2 bed, 2 bath in Hayes Valley. I love the apartment but my current roommate is moving out to live with her boyfriend. This would be a lease renewal for 1-yr, starting in July. \n\nThe building is managed, with a doorman from 8am-8pm, gym, roof with grill, and a parking garage. The apartment itself is spacious, gets a lot of sunlight, has in-unit washer and dryer, and has a balcony. The apartment is mostly furnished, but that can be discussed. Roommate's portion of rent would be $2325 excluding utilities. \n\nI'm an early thirties female who recently moved to the city for a new job after completing my MBA. I'm quiet and tidy. Preference for a female roommate with similar quiet and tidy habits. If you've made it this far, please comment your favorite fruit when you reply.",

We live in a house called the Unicorn Ring.\n\nThe Unicorn Ring is a spacious Victorian style home with vaulted ceilings in a glorious location! We are located off of Market and San Pablo, right in the middle of downtown, Emeryville, Temescal, Lake, Merritt, Berkeley and West Oakland. 4 blocks away from the freeway and 3 min drive or 20 min walk to MacArthur BART station or 19th st. The 72 BUS is right by our house and runs every 5 min. Besides having a great location, our house has a magical energy that can be felt by anyone who enters! We are welcoming all bad ass, compassionate, silly, good smelling humans who like to bathe regularly to join out family! Are you the one?🤪 \n\nAll of us are artists who wish to better ourselves and the world around us. We believe that building a strong, tight community is the first step to find happiness!\n\n(Please note that we cannot have cats here due to allergies…sorry cat lovers!)\n\nThe downstairs room is a 11’x10’ space. The downstairs two rooms have a shared bathroom and there is also a bathroom upstairs. The downstairs bathroom has a shower and the upstairs has a bath and shower and is shared by everyone. There is a washer and dryer in the unit. Huge kitchen, plenty of storage space and a huge driveway. The property has four units on it. One is the bottom floor of this three-story house and there are two other units behind the house. The property is protected by a 6 foot gate. There isn’t too much room to garden, but you are welcome to join me! Check out the pictures and see how you like the space.\n\nRent and deposit each $900. \nW/S/G included in rent\nPG&E runs between $300-$500 depending on the time of year.\nInternet Sonic $83\nAll utilities are split 5 ways (so you would be paying $16 for Internet and, at most, $100 for PG&E)\nWe use Splitwise for the shared bills and tp. \n\n\nWe are all busy responsible adults that spend a lot of time focused on ourselves, but we love to spend time with each other when we come together naturally. We keep a clean space, but we are also not tight asses. None of us drink much. No pets currently. \n\n\nA little bit about us:\n\nI, Honey, am 35, ENFJ, Libra, double psych and music major at Cal State East Bay, Nanny, vocalist, event hostess, cook and clown. I really love people! I threw a monthly jam here at the house. Hope you like live funk music!\n\nJohn, 45, Dr. of Music composition with a masters in experimental psychology. Pianist, middle school teacher, a complete anomaly of a human being! You’ve never met anyone like him!\n\nJasmyne, 36, gorgeous bartender/waitress, has a beautiful dog named Maze. Maze is PERFECT..OMG, talk about a good dog! Jasmyne is often out of the house but dumb fun to be around when she’s home!\n\nAll except myself are out of the house most of the time.\n\nWe are hoping to fill them by the 9th. Background check required at the expense of the applicant.\n\nIt has been a long journey for everyone to find the right space to call home! We are very open minded and accepting of all humans but also very protective of our space. The expectations we have of our new roommate, besides the obvious, paying rent on time and keeping the space reasonably clean, is; clear, communication, and a mature, self aware attitude. All four of us are very direct, assertive and humorous. Hakuna Matata, as long as we are all sharing mutual respect for one another. Looking forward to meeting you!\n\nPlease feel free to message me if you prefer that over email.\n\nThank you and happy hunting!",

My 4 bd/3 bath home is drama-free, quiet, clean, well-kept and located down a private off-street driveway, in a safe Santa Rosa family-friendly neighborhood. Looking for one mature, low-key older roommate, who is also easy-going, drama-free, conscientious of water and PGE use and recycling. Keeping a clean home and pro-active communication are priorities and a must for you as well. Hoping to find one, long-term roommate with a good sense of humor to share my home with.\n\nI live with my sweet, friendly Shiba Inu. Your one, small (25-lb), well-behaved, healthy, neutered/spayed dog is welcome here - after the dogs meet and \"The Shiba Paw of Approval\".  Let's trade occasional dog care. Then once the dogs settle in together, we each can then take an occasional short trip, knowing our pups are safe with \"friends\" at home.  If you don't have a dog but love their energy and having one in your life, I'm open to discussing rent reduction in exchange for dog care while I'm on an occasional trip.\n\n$1375 Security Deposit. Initial 6-month Rental Agreement, then month-to-month.  Move-in date can be flexible; let's talk.\n\nNo Home Businesses, Heavy Gamers, nor E-Traders.",

    "price": 1200,
    "location": "mission district",
    "description": "Hello.\n\nIf your heart is in Berkeley but you live in San Francisco, let's talk. I have a spacious, sunny apartment in the Mission. The place is fully furnished, except for the bedroom (which is approximately 12’ x 12’; with 4.5’ x 2.5’ closet). The last roommate/former occupant took off for grad school.\n\nABOUT THE PLACE:\nLarge Living Room w/working fireplace\nFormal Dining Room\nKitchen w/Pantry\nSun-Deck\nSmall Inner Patio\nSplit Bath\nWasher/Dryer, Dishwasher\nLimited storage space\nStreet parking, but VERY close to MUNI/BART (1 block)\n\nABOUT ME:\nI'm male, and work in education. I work from 8 - 6 or longer and when I’m done I like to enjoy laid-back, quiet, lazy evenings at home. Home is sanctuary, and I'm not the sort who always has to be constantly on-the-go. I like to enjoy a nice meal, have some wine, watch TV, talk, laugh, and unwind. I watch a lot of sports (mostly tennis, but also track & field, football, etc.) and regular programs (Supernatural, Family Guy, SNL, and 60 Minutes to name a few). I also like to channel surf (ESPN/2, Discovery, BBC, History, TV Land). Or, I’m cool just having a lazy day to meditate, read, or sit and do nothing. I also like to go to movies, the symphony, comedy shows, a good sports bar or a bad dive bar. On the weekends, I like to sleep-in late. I'm mostly reserved, but I can be loud once I warm up and I have a good sense of humor—sometimes dark, sometimes dry. I'm not a neat-freak but cleanliness is a must: messy is one thing; dirty is something else entirely.\n\nABOUT YOU:\nI'm looking for someone who is laid-back, and who is gainfully employed or otherwise able to pay rent/utilities on time; someone who takes care of things and is responsible, and who communicates well. I am looking for a roommate who wants a home (even if temporary) and not just a place to stay—not necessarily a best friend or partner-in-crime, but also not looking to live like two strangers. I definitely want a roomie who wants to have a pretty casual living environment, to hang out and talk, laugh, watch some tv, and have a meal or two together. Since there’s a shared bathroom, ideally am looking to live with another guy. (In a shared space there can be various states of undress: partial nudity or just nude. I am NOT nudist, but naked happens.) If you play cards and board games, you rock! If you're not a snob or a bigot, that's best. If you're into get-togethers with lots of good food, drinking some, and laughing A LOT, that's awesome. But my party days are over so no late, loud nights. Open communication and mutual respect are ESSENTIAL.\n\nABOUT THE NOPE\nNo pets (due to allergies)\nNo smoking\nNo drugs\nNo couples or frequent overnight guests\nThank you in advance.\n\nABOUT THE DETAILS:\nCosts (approximate and negotiable): First Month's Rent $1,200 + Move-in Deposit $1,200 = $2,400; Utilities (PG&E, Cable) average ~ $100/month. Availability (negotiable): August 1 or Sept 1.\n\nSo, if you’re interested in a quality living environment, drop me a note and let me know a little about yourself and what you’re seeking.\n\nThanks.",
